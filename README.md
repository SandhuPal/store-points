Running the project
Running the project is as simple as running

'npm run start'

This runs the start script specified in our package.json, and will spawn off a server which reloads the page as we save our files. Typically the server runs at http://localhost:3000, but should be automatically opened for you.

This tightens the iteration loop by allowing us to quickly preview changes.
